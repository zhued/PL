### 1. JavaScripty Interpreter: Tag Testing, Recursive Funtions, and Dynamic Scoping
**a.**  Give one test case that behaves differently under dynamic scoping versus static scoping (and does not crash). Explain the test case and how they behave differently in your write-up.

Example of Differences w/ Scoping: 
 ``` javascript
	const x = 0;

	const callFunc = function(y) { return x; };
	const runFunc = function(x) { return callFunc(42); };

	runFunc(10);
 ```

If this program was ran on with a dynamically typed language, then runFunc(10) would return 10. This is because the scope of the function callFunc will be within the same scope in the function runFunc, where the const 'x' that is taking into runFunc is changed from the 'x' outside its scope that was set to 0 to the value 10. So then the 'x' variable in callFunc will reference the value of 10 from runFunc, so the 'x' that is being returned in callFunc will be 10.

When this program is ran under static scoping, even though the 'x' in runFunc gets changed to 10 from 0, when callFunc(42) gets called, the scope within the callFunc is separtate from the scope of runFunc, thus the 'x' in runFunc is bound to the outside scope at the very beginning of the value 0. Thus x in this case would print 0.



### 2. JavaScripty Interpereter: Substitution and Evaluation Order
**c.** Explain whether the evaluation order is deterministic as specified by judgement form e -> eprime.

The evaluation order is deterministic. The evaluation order is e1 then e2. We require e1 and e2 to be values, and if they aren't, we evaluate e1 to a value v1. And after e1 is a value, the search rules then calls on evaluating e2 to a value v2. Step(e1) is called before the interpreter check if e2 is a value, in the cases where neither of them are values.


### 3. Evaluation Order
Consider the small-step orperational semantics for JavaScripty schown in Figures 7, 8, and 9. What is the evaluation order for e1 and e2? Explain. How do we change the rules optain the opposite evaluation order?

The evaluation order for e1 and e2 is from left to right.

Until both e1 and e2 are values, we recurse search rules until they are reduced to values. SEARCHBINARY1 is used to make sure e1 reduces to a value, and will recursively do so until it is.

 ```
 e1 -> e1'
 -----------------------
 e1 bop e2 -> e1' bop e2
 ``` 

From the above function, after e1 evalutes to a value, SEARCHBINARYARITH2 can then be used to reduce e2.

 ```
 e2 -> e2'      bop +
 -----------------------
 v1 bop v2 -> v1 bop e2'
 ``` 

It is visible here that it is required for e1 to be evaluated to a value v1 before SEARCHBINARYARITH2 can even start, therefore we can conclude that the evaluation order is left to right, that is e1 must be evaluted to a value first before e2 can be evaluated.

This order can be reversed if we insert a case that calls on e2 and evaluates it until it becomes a value before even evaluating e1. This will force e2 to be evaluated before e1, which is the exact opposite of what is given above.


### 4. Short-Circuit Evaluation
**a.** Concept: Give an example that illustrates the usefulness of short circuit evaluation. Explain your example.

An example of short circuit being useful is when once we evaluate a value of one expression we don't have to evaluate any other expressions because we know what the end evaluation will be. For example, in multiplying two expressions (e1 and e2), if e1 is evaluated to the value 0, then we don't even need to evaluate e2 because it will eventually evaluate to zero in the end. If e2 was a massive expression, then short circuiting will definitely help the performance of evaluation, as it won't have to evalute the large expression e2 at all. 


**b.** JavaScripty. Consider the small-step operational semantics for JAVASCRIPTY shown in Figures 7, 8, and 9. Does e1&&e2 short circuit? Explain.

Yes, e1&&e2 will short circuit because in the DoAndFalse judgement, when toBoolean(v1) is false, then the expression v1&&e2 will evaluate to just v1 and will not even need to evaluate e2. This is possible because the behavior of the '&&' will return a false immediately once one of the values is false, so if v1 is false, we can automatically evaluate v1&&e2 to v1 which is false.
